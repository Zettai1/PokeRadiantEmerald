# Pokémon Radiant Emerald

This is a fork of the project to create a decompiled version of Pokémon Emerald.

This ROM hack has the goal of redesigning shiny and increasing the chance that they occur.

It builds the following ROM:

* [**pokeemerald.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) `sha1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
